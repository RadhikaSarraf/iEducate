            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Male inheritance and property ownership, early marriage, dowry, honor crimes, lack girls’ education, witch hunting, violence against women, and trafficking are all serious issues in the country. There are schools, but most girls do not attend, often because of religious reasons or cultural pressures.The burden of housework on Indian girls is a spiraling crisis for India. In its 2015 report on gender inequality in India, the McKinsey Global Institute found that Indian women perform nearly 10 times the unpaid care work as men. That’s almost three times more than the global average. Housework accounts for 85 percent of the time women in India spend on unpaid care work, the 2018 report found. And much of this is either shared or shouldered by young girls like Neha, who should ideally be in school. “Girls who do two hours of housework per day have a 63 percent probability of finishing secondary school,”</p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Girls are mostly discriminated in society and are often humiliated in family. According to UNESCO, girls contribution in household works is 64% more than boys. TushyaShakti.com is pledged to start unique education system for girls of all classes (upper, middle or lower) without any discrimination. It will be based on ancient theme with all modern infrastructure and hostel facility. A-Z staffs will be female, no entry for male inside campus. Currently Lonavala and Solan has been chosen. We urge you to contribute for our project as much as you can. There is no lower or higher limit for contribution.And herein it is that I take upon me to make such a bold assertion, That all the world are mistaken in their practice about women. For I cannot think that God Almighty ever made them so delicate, so glorious creatures; and furnished them with such charms, so agreeable and so delightful to mankind; with souls capable of the same accomplishments with men: and all, to be only Stewards of our Houses, Cooks, and Slaves. </p>

            <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The role of women in development is most intimately related
                to the goal of comprehensive social, educational and economic
                development, and is a strategic question for the development of all
                societies. In this regard, it is worthwhile quoting the words of Pandit
                Jawaharlal Nehru, the first Prime Minister of India: “To awaken the
                people, it is the woman who must be awakened and if she is on the
                move, the family moves, the village moves, the village moves and
                the nation moves”. Thus, a long way back, Pandit Nehru visualised
                the importance of women in social, educational and economic
                development.. There is an urgent need to prepare more and more success
                stories through the print and audio-visual media so that both the
                educated and the uneducated can be inspired to participate in the
                national endeavour</p>
